# 4chan_media_downloader
paste 4chan thread links in the textbox and hit the "download threads" button.

pressing the image button on the top-left corner will display a new window, selecting the checkbox in the "put computer to sleep when finished" reply will indeed *"put the computer to sleep when finished"* (some times the pc won't go to sleep mode if some threads return an exception when downloading, did not look into it yet so that function is not guaranteed to work)
